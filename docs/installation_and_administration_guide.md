# Netfloc Installation guide

## System Requirements

JAVA 7 JDK, Maven 3.1.1, Vagrant and VirtualBox.
To run tests you will need OpenFlow 1.3 enabled network devices or Mininet and OpenvSwitch.
You can use the following source to download Vagrant machine with Mininet and OVS.

```
$git clone https://github.com/illotum/vagrant-mininet.git 
$cd vagrant-mininet
$vagrant up && vagrant ssh

```

## Installation and Testing

``` 
# Clone the Netfloc repo:

$git clone https://github.com/icclab/netfloc.git
$cd netfloc
$mvn clean install
```

## Troubleshooting

```
#If you experience some errors in the build regarding some missing bundles or features, please run the following:

$rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/opendaylight/
$mvn clean install

If the problem happens when you introduced some changes and installed new bundles / features in Netfloc, try this:

$rm -rf journals snapshots
$bin/karaf clean

It will clean the distribution data store from the previous executions.

What you can also do once you work with a stable version of features and bundles and don't want Maven to check online for new artifacts is go offline mode after the successful build. For that you will need to have all the artifacts available in your Maven Local repo and use the dependency plugin's "go-offline". 

$mvn dependency:go-offline
$mvn clean install -o

```
## Sanity Check Procedures
### End to End testing
Netfloc already includes the Lithium version of the OpenDayligh controller. 
To run it, all you have to do is:

```
$cd karaf/target/assembly/
$./bin/karaf

```

You should see the karaf console of the OpenDaylgith controller. 
As a simple test run the topology discovery feature by starting a Miniet topology in the Vagrant machine and then installing flows on the ovs switch for LLDP traffic discovery. Netfloc uses this feature to notify the graph library any time a new switch (aka link) has been inserted in the SDN environment.

``` 
$mn  --topo linear,3 --mac --controller remote,ip=[Netfloc_Machine_IP]

mininet> h1 ping h2

$sudo ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:[Netfloc_Machine_IP]:6640

$sudo ovs-ofctl add-flow s3 dl_type=0x88cc,actions=output:controller

$sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows [bridge_name]

$ovs-ofctl dump-flows

```

### List of Running Processes
There has to be one java virtual machine running. You can find it like so:

```

$ps aux | grep karaf
#or
$ps aux | grep netfloc

```

### Network Interfaces Up & Open
The ODL controller must be listing on the following TCP ports via its java process:

```

lsof -i | grep 6633
lsof -i | grep 6640

```

### Databases
The ODL controller uses an internal (MDSAL) datastore which is automatically installed in the feature installation procedure.

## Diagnosis Procedures
### Resource Availability
For compilation the following is needed:

```
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1028m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
```

### Remote Service Access
N/A

### Resource consumption
N/A

### I/O flows
